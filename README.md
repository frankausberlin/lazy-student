Video playlists collections transcriptions bilingual for prompt engineering

A google colab notebook - use the 'Open in Colab' button.

This is for the work-optimized student - openai's [prompt engineering](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) with access to collections of video-lecture transicriptions, focused on bilingualism and yaml persistence.

* Choose your language and your collection - select a course and a video - build your chapters - clean it, prompt it, loop it - be creative...
* The prompt functions needs an **[openai](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage)** account for send your gpt request direct out of the widget.
* If you have **no account** you can still use it (no aichapters, gpt only as text, no prompt translation). Use copy/paste and a **[public gpt](https://poe.com/)** instead.
* It manages collections on your **session**, **gdrive** (~ 50 MB max) or **local runtime** - there are two examples (new ones can easily be added):
  * ['Practical Deeplearning for Coders'](https://course.fast.ai/) by fastai (**folder dlfc**) and 
  * A [collection by Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/@stanfordonline/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=4): CS221, CS224, CS229, CS330 (**folder stanford**).
* A **collection** is a list of several youtube **playlists** (playlists.yml) with its own **folder** for the **created yml** files.
* More questions? **Look in the help tab or code** - there are more detailed descriptions.
